            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For although the <hi>tenderneſſe</hi> of Gods

            </p>
            <p>Whereas if, but with <hi>patience</hi> and ſerenity men would
<hi>expect the end,</hi> they would quickly change their opinion, and diſcerne Gods <hi>glory</hi> and his <hi>Churches</hi> good, to break through thoſe <hi>diſmall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances;</hi> and that thoſe <hi>diſorders</hi> which carry a face of <hi>horror to us,</hi> look with <hi>another</hi> kinde of <hi>aſpect towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when the <hi>aire</hi> is covered with <hi>black</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous clouds, our ſenſes torne with thunder &amp; lightning; all things may ſeem to be in an <hi>irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable confuſion below,</hi> though the <hi>ſame calmeneſſe</hi> interruptedly <hi>ſits in Heaven; ſo,</hi> whilſt the World lies in a <hi>diſtemper</hi> and all things be together by the eares below <hi>on earth,</hi> our judgment may be

            <p>They that confine God to be onely a <hi>General beginning</hi> of a <hi>confus'd</hi> motion, do ſtrive to rob God of <hi>one</hi> of his moſt glorious attributes, <hi>omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</hi> as if <hi>once he</hi> ſhould command a <hi>River,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelf within its preſcribed <hi>channel;</hi> but yet; <hi>not be conſcious and intent, upon every winding curle</hi> of its <hi>ſtreame;</hi> by <hi>which opinion</hi> as we ſtrip God of his <hi>glory,</hi> ſo we deprive our ſelves of very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for if man were nakedly expos'd to the <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the

            </p>
            <p>And although man is alwaies <hi>too prone</hi> in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, to indulge his corruptions in a <hi>deniall of a peculiar providence;</hi> yet he never more <hi>greedily</hi> runs into <hi>this peece of Atheiſme:</hi> Then upon <hi>the <pb facs="tcp:170403:9"/> proſperity of the wicked,</hi> and the afflictions of the juſt; when he findes <hi>perſecuted innocence</hi> wandring in <hi>baniſhment,</hi> and <hi>drooping</hi> under a loade of <hi>chaines,</hi> whilſt <hi>impiety wantonly</hi> roules it ſelfe upon <hi>a throne:</hi> when they dare <hi>father</hi> their <hi>wickedneſs upon Heaven, and yet proſper, and do grow great</hi> by being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly

            <p>But how poor and unfortunate an argument a little ſucceſſe is, of a <hi>good cauſe,</hi> (as all ages ſo) the late ſtupendious alterations of providence, (which hath unexpectedly <hi>taken off</hi> the

            <p>To indeavour after an <hi>eminency</hi> in Religion ought to be every mans <hi>ambition,</hi> but to pretend <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> meerly for

                  <p>Curioſity of a diviſion is ſuperfluous. We finde here 1.
<hi>Elohim</hi> the <hi>Almighty God</hi> mentioned with his <hi>active, relative Goodneſſe.</hi> 2. The <hi>object.</hi> 1. <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely</hi> expreſſed. 2. More <hi>particularly explained;</hi> Laſtly a
<hi>Patheticall</hi> aſſeveration <hi>Truely,</hi> which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the
<hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> of the thing affirmed; recommending it, to the beliefe of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gods Goodneſſe</hi> may be conſidered either as
<hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute</hi> in <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or <hi>relative</hi> towards
<hi>others. Thou art good O Lord and doſt Good</hi> Pſal. 119. This carries a difference from each other. The 1. is his <hi>eſſence;</hi> the 2. a
<hi>ſtreame</hi> running from that <hi>fountaine</hi> upon the
<hi>creature.</hi> 2. The firſt is <hi>abſolutely neceſſarie,</hi> (it not being <hi>poſsible</hi> that God ſhould be <hi>otherwiſe then good;</hi>) the ſecond is <hi>free</hi> as being an act of that
<hi>will,</hi> which is <hi>abſolutely free.</hi> Thirdly <hi>Gods eſſentiall goodneſſe,</hi> is ever <hi>equally perfect</hi> and
<hi>admitts</hi> of no degrees, either of <hi>Intention</hi> or <hi>Remiſsion more</hi> or <hi>leſſe.</hi> Whereas <hi>that</hi> which is
<hi>relative</hi> is Imparted in a thouſand varieties, and

<hi>all</hi> Gods creatures be <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170403:26"/> 
                     <hi>good</hi> yet they are not <hi>equally ſo, thoſe</hi> claiming the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and out

                  <p>This later <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> is that which the

                  </p>
                  <p>From which it may be concluded;<note place="margin">Aplic.</note> that if we carry Gods <hi>Image</hi> as men, and be conformed to Chriſt as Chriſtians we muſt teſtifie ſo much by the relative expreſſions of our <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> to others.

<hi>ſtrict</hi> obliging preceps which bind us to mutuall love and endearements; and we cannot do harme, without the unhappy contracting of
<hi>guilt</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Puniſhment:</hi>

                  <p>Men may (by an imaginarie reflexion upon their
<hi>Majeſtie</hi> or conceited <hi>Parts</hi>) fancie themſelves more then ordinarily <hi>high,</hi> yet the Apoſtle aſſures us, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>

                  <p>The name Iſrael imparts not only a <hi>ſociety,</hi> viſibly owning the profeſſion of true Religion, but it expreſſes the
<hi>Church inviſible:</hi> It being more to <hi>be</hi> Iſrael then to be of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6. hence the Apoſtle beſtowes his <hi>peace</hi> and

                  <p>Theſe are they whom the prophet here more eſpecially reflects upon, as the object of Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> to whom he allows the deſcription, of a <hi>cleane heart.</hi> Its Originall
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the neceſſary qualification of a <hi>true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> a ſoul <hi>ſincerely affected</hi> with the truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and <hi>acting</hi> in a ſuitable, intire, <hi>obedience,</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the <hi>outward marks</hi> which diſcriminate onely from

<hi>Inviſible,</hi> not but their free innocent <hi>lives,</hi> their exemplary perſons, their reſolute profeſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<hi>viſibly</hi> to the world in an open luſter; but becauſe there lies a coſtly mine <hi>within,</hi> which mans eye cannot reach unto. Their hearts are naked <hi>only</hi> to their <hi>Maker,</hi> and their faith and ſincerity ſoare upon too high, and too refined wings to be maſter'd by the dulneſſe of ſenſe. Their <hi>better part</hi> though eyd by God, yet is <hi>Inviſible</hi> to <hi>man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Gods goodneſſe peculiarly attends this
<hi>True-cleane-hearted Iſrael,</hi> will be evident, If we conſider</p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Peculiar exhortations</hi> therefore, meet with

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Whether the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church may totally faile?</note>And this is thought proveable. 1. By the Nature of Chriſtian Religion, which is made up of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands &amp; Promiſes, requiring

               </p>
               <p>In the firſt, Ver. (the Hiſtorical declaration of what befell him,) we may finde theſe particulars. 1. <hi>The danger wherein he was like to be plung'd, to the</hi> 17. <hi>verſe.</hi> And ſecondly, thoſe

                  <note place="margin">The danger generally deſcribed.</note> He tells us that his
<hi>feet were almost gone.</hi> The word ſignifies to <hi>bow,</hi> or

               <p>Though <hi>theſe expreſſions</hi> be <hi>metaphorical,</hi> and ſeemingly dark and cloudy: Yet they cleerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto us this truth: That <hi>his underſtanding</hi> was <hi>miſguided;</hi> His

                  <hi>his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections diſordered,</hi> turbulent and guilty of too <hi>great</hi> a paſſion: And this, the <hi>conſequents, vers</hi> 22. <hi>(When he acknowledges himſelf, ignorant, fooliſh; and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh)</hi> doe ſufficiently evidence. Our <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> may well bear the compariſon to <hi>feet,</hi> for as the <hi>one,</hi> in our motion,
<hi>ſupports</hi> the <hi>body.</hi> So the <hi>other,</hi> in humane actions, and all imployments <hi>underprops</hi> the <hi>ſoul.</hi> The

               </p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:170403:42"/> and wander out of the <hi>right</hi> way. And being that all <hi>ſinners</hi> are <hi>led</hi> by <hi>luſts</hi> and predominant, fleſhly affections, a ſuitable character deſcribes them to have <hi>corrupted their</hi> ways, <hi>Gen.</hi>
6.12. And <hi>Turners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, Pſal.</hi> 14.3. And <hi>dwellers in a crooked path.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that once gives himſelf over to his <hi>owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and takes that for the <hi>rule</hi> of his actions; he who follows his owne paſſionate affections, may fall into thoſe precipices, which are not eaſily maiſtered. And run into thoſe heavy inconveniences, which too many in the World do grone under.</p>
               <p>He therefore who would not willingly <hi>tranſgreſſe</hi> his right bounds, nor diviate into <hi>crooked</hi> miſhapen paths, muſt have an <hi>extraordinary</hi> eye both to <hi>His underſtanding and judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if thoſe <hi>grand Pillars</hi> tremble, the <hi>whole</hi> will <hi>droope:</hi> If once we be <hi>leavened</hi> with <hi>errors</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, <hi>corrupt opinions,</hi> if being deſtitute of truth, the vanity of <hi>miſleading</hi> principles ſway us, our <hi>ſteps</hi> will ſoon <hi>run to miſchiefe</hi> and diſorder. The original of the Gentiles amazed wanderings are <hi>blindneſſe</hi> and vanity of <hi>Mind, Eph.</hi>
4.17.18. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he who upon an happy renewall of the Spirit of his mind, preſerves his <hi>judgment right,</hi> and intire, will eaſily maſter his

               <p>And whereas it may be pleaded, That many who are furniſht with a fair competency of knowledge, doe lye under thoſe <hi>luſts,</hi> and paſſions, which are brutiſh, and exorbitant.</p>
               <p>It may be returned; that there is much difference to be made betwixt, a <hi>conſtant, permanent, habitual</hi> ſway of luſts, and a
<hi>temporary</hi> or <hi>occaſionall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170403:42"/>Some there are, who are fixt, in a ſetled, pleaſing ſlavery unto their luſts, in whom <hi>ſin</hi> bears a Scepter, and <hi>reignes,</hi> whoſe onely trade, and cuſtome, is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: of theſe, we may eaſily <hi>determine</hi> that what ever
<hi>Theoretical knowledge</hi> they appeare owners of; yet, are they not, in their judgments, <hi>truely</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the <hi>truth</hi> of thoſe
<hi>good principles;</hi> nor maſters of <hi>that</hi> perſwaſion, which carries an <hi>influence</hi> unto ſelf-application; though they may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>apprehend them,</hi> yet do they not <hi>beleeve</hi> that they <hi>concerne</hi> or belong unto them: If they laid them as they ſhould, to heart, they would more conſcientiouſly, bridle their paſſions, and rectifie their way.</p>
               <p>Others there are, the Bent &amp; <hi>Inclination</hi> of whoſe ſouls, are wholly taken up with <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe;</hi> and if at any time, a turbulent <hi>paſsion</hi> or a partial <hi>affection, tranſport</hi> them <hi>occaſionally,</hi> it cannot be denied, but that in that <hi>particular</hi> their <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>judgment fail</hi> them.</p>
               <p>He therefore that would preſerve to himſelf <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified thoughts,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> and correſpondent actions; muſt have an eye, that the maine <hi>ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of his <hi>ſoul,</hi> be firme, and uncorrupt, rightly founded upon the word of Truth. This, is that Method which Gods Spirit always makes uſe of to a through converſion; their

<hi>then</hi> their <hi>judgments</hi> are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the <hi>truths revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it may be concluded, that they, who ſcoffingly refuſe inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hate to be reformed, who deſpiſe any indeavours of <hi>others</hi> to <hi>better</hi> them; ſcorning to be perſwaded to a right <hi>underſtanding</hi> or to be convinc't of their <hi>errors</hi> do but cheriſh and <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170403:43"/> ſtrengthen violent <hi>affections</hi> which will ſoon force them to <hi>crooked,</hi> perverſe and diſordered

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>danger generally</hi> deſcribed cannot well be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt without taking ſome ſhort notice of the Perſon whoſe

                  <p>From hence we may learne. 1. <hi>To vindicate the effects of Providence from the common imputations of men;</hi> who oft lay the

                  <p>

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Proud mans</hi> firſt object is

                  <p>This high <hi>Proud Temper</hi> though we are all very

<hi>If any man among you, ſeem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart; This mans religion is vaine:</hi> Though he be a conſtant frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of holy exerciſes; yet if his unreſtrained tongue runs to railing, his religion is <hi>vaine:</hi> And what is that? Vanity in Scripture is oppoſed 1. To <hi>Truth.</hi> 2. To <hi>fruit</hi> and
<hi>benefit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This mans religion then is <hi>vaine</hi> 1. There is no
<hi>truth</hi> in it; it wants that, which it ſeems; a meer ſhaddow, without ſubſtance. <hi>It is vaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit</hi> ſuch, a ſeeming religion will do him no good; and ſtand him in a very little ſtead when it comes to triall.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this, with the addition of this one thing. Men have no great cauſe to applaud, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to boaſt in this licence, of an uncontrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tongue: there may be a <hi>permittance,</hi> and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

                  <p>But the demand is <hi>Rhetoricall, abſolutely</hi> and

<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is ſtill upon the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>That to deny a knowledge in God is a piece of the higheſt and moſt monſtrous Impiety, En quo res pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpera mentes Perducit miſeras,</hi> This is that pillar up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which <hi>nil ultra,</hi> no

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For its <hi>nature</hi> it is no leſſe then
<hi>Plaine</hi> downe right <hi>Atheiſme.</hi> For</p>
                  <p>Firſt here is a <hi>deniall of Gods knowledge, How doth God know?</hi> they will not afford <hi>heaven,</hi> to be ſo much as a ſpectator of their Actions, for we muſt not imagine, that theſe ſuppoſed a God; and only <hi>denyed him knowing:</hi> but they deny that there is any <hi>ſuch God who doth know.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170403:67"/>2. By taking <hi>it away;</hi> they deny, a <hi>providence,</hi> and Divine care, of things below.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence alſo, they <hi>denied</hi> a <hi>prudent,</hi> ſupreame <hi>Management</hi> of things, here below: conſtituting blinde

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>deny</hi> an <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> of power, or any ſuch, as is <hi>greater</hi> then <hi>themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They deny a Divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man, according to his works.</p>
                  <p>So, that if <hi>all this</hi> be put together: To <hi>deny</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Knowledge, Providence, Government, Power and Juſtice;</hi> we may finde, it do's <hi>amount,</hi> to nothing <hi>leſſe,</hi> then direct
<hi>Denial of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>grounds</hi> of this impiety, thoſe will heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>ſin:</hi> It may ſeem very ſtrange, that Mans heart, indued with <hi>reaſon,</hi> ſhould give admiſſion to ſo
<hi>irrational</hi> a thought. Eſpecially, conſidering.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That very reaſon, and their ſoul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are innobled, might teach them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He, that <hi>teacheth, man knowledge, ſhall not he know?</hi> Things <hi>without,</hi> in their abſtruſe cauſes, and effects, their properties, and qualities, natural, and moral, may ſtoop to <hi>mans knowledge;</hi> which, he, never came unto, by the inſtruction of beaſts; who never had any; nor did <hi>it</hi> flow, originally from himſelf, no more then his owne <hi>being.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it muſt ſtreame, from an heavenly fountaine, which could not diſpenſe <hi>knowledge</hi> to us, unleſſe <hi>it had it, it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. If, <hi>theſe men,</hi> do conſult with every thing
<hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them, they may finde, the whole creation, the

                  <p>But as when we find, much rubbiſh and dirt caſt upon the ſhore, we eaſily aſſigne it to the <hi>violence</hi> of that liquid element; whoſe waves forc't it thither. So when ſuch deſperate and blaſphemous concluſions come abroade, we may eaſily know that they proceed, from thoſe <hi>wicked</hi> mens hearts; who foame out their <hi>owne ſhame;</hi> The inward rowling thoughts toſs't up and down by the
<hi>devils ſecret</hi> ſuggeſtions, are the originall of all this
<hi>Atheiſme</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſaid the <hi>Secret ſuggeſtions of the Divell:</hi> for he never hath or will be willing, to be the known <hi>Maſter</hi> of
<hi>Atheiſme:</hi> Amongſt thoſe whom he was permitted to be moſt viſibly converſant with: he was not ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, to tempt them
<hi>farther,</hi> then to the worſhip of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and he well knows that ſhould he appeare to be the Maſter of Atheiſme, to teach it; the very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own <hi>being,</hi> would confute him and his doctrine: for it might be rationally concluded; That if there were intellectuall ſpirits (ſuch as the <hi>Devil</hi> is,) There muſt certainly be a firſt <hi>Being,</hi> a God who gave them, both their being and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>Every man hath ſome notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill; honeſt,</hi> and <hi>diſhoneſt;</hi> imprinted in his ſoul, which are undeniably cleare: when ſuch men as theſe, then view themſelves, wholy converſant, in things evill and diſhoneſt; Their own conſcience, accuſeth them; and aſſures them withall, that they deſerve to be dealt with <hi>proportionably</hi> to their wicked actings: hence ariſeth a feare of puniſhment which is both augmented and confirmed in them by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170403:68"/> general beleife, of <hi>all men,</hi> (beſides themſelves) that <hi>there is a God.</hi> Whoſe wrath, <hi>is revealed from heaven, againſt all unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> This <hi>feare</hi> they ſtrive againſt; and are willing to be rid <hi>of it;</hi> their <hi>owne proſperity helps</hi> it on; their <hi>preſent</hi> immunity perſwades them, and the Devils <hi>ſecret</hi> ſuggeſtions confirme them: and thus at length, (as Man, is eaſily induced, to <hi>beleeve that</hi> which he likes, and to <hi>disbeleive</hi> that which would trouble him) they
<hi>reſolve,</hi> and <hi>conclude,</hi> and ſay. <hi>How doth God know?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus affected it is no wonder, they ſhould be ſo wicked, as they are deſcribed to be. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caſt off all fear of God; trampled all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under foot; what can be expected of them, but that they ſhould be <hi>proud, oppreſſors, bloody, inhumane;</hi> and live according to their owne blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts, pleaſures, and <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>Nay certainly it were hardly conceiveable, that they ſhould be
<hi>ſo wicked,</hi> unleſſe they had ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently denied that firſt principle of all goodneſſe. <hi>That there is an all knowing God — nunquam — tam perfidus ac perjurus fuiſset ſi putaſſet eſſe deos. — Heu primae ſcelerum cauſae mortalibus aegris, naturam neſcire dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For he, whoſe ſoul, firmely beleives, <hi>That there is a God:</hi> That <hi>all things</hi> lye open, and naked, to his eye, whom we have to deale with. He neither will, nor can, be ſo preſumptuouſly wicked: A thought of <hi>this</hi> kept tempted <hi>Joſeph,</hi> from uncleanneſſe with his wanton Miſtreſſe; and to cry, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe &amp; ſin againſt God? Gen.</hi> 39.9. A reflexion upon <hi>Gods omniſcience</hi> quickens good <hi>Davids</hi> devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170403:68"/> 
                     <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.1, 2, 3. And from thoughts of this <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> takes the aſſurance to reprove the wicked, 1

                  </p>
                  <p>But here, it may be objected. That in theſe latter dayes, after ſo long, and undeniable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of <hi>Gods knowledge,</hi> the
<hi>ſame</hi> ſins are comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: men are as eminently active in
<hi>violence, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion, and blood ſhedding,</hi> as ever: and this Pſalme is too ſadly fulfilled, men are proud, <hi>revengefull, reſtleſſe;</hi> that (not long ſince) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, flouriſhing Kingdomes are at their laſt <hi>gaſpe;</hi> and yet never <hi>higher</hi> profeſſion of <hi>Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or more <hi>zealous</hi> pretences of
<hi>Reformation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be anſwered; That the <hi>Antecedent</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, things are too manifeſt. Yet tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are yet to ſeeke, how the committall, of ſuch impieties, can ſtand with the <hi>true beleife of God, and his knowledge:</hi> The <hi>verbal</hi> profeſſion of God and his glory excuſes not <hi>ſuch workers</hi> from reall <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> Theſe very <hi>works</hi> being denials both of Gods <hi>knowledge</hi> and
<hi>providence.</hi> Let us not be too ſecure; whilſt we are totally bent upon exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Popery, another Enemy</hi> proves <hi>as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</hi> What is it that hath robd us of our friends and eſtates? But
<hi>Atheiſme.</hi> What is it that hath ſhed the blood of ſo many innocents, and under the cloake of a <hi>pretended</hi> Reformation, hath Triumph't in the diſturbance of our peace, and the ruines of our Kingdomes, but <hi>Atheiſme? <pb n="90" facs="tcp:170403:69"/> He, onely</hi> he hath reduc't us to theſe miſeries and wrought our woe; that ſayes in his <hi>heart there is no God:</hi> and imperiouſly demands, <hi>is there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the moſt high?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As, for thoſe demure <hi>pretences,</hi> wherewith they ſpeciouſly guild their actings; They are ſo far from <hi>excuſing,</hi> as they make their <hi>Atheiſme</hi> more <hi>horrid;</hi> and ſerve, to render it more perniciouſly effectual, ſpreading and contagious; ſhould men <hi>openly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>They fear not Gods knowledge,</hi> they would not have, ſo many applauding followers; but now whilſt they politiquely, <hi>pretend his ſervice;</hi> and yet <hi>deny him, in their actings;</hi> they indanger many, who look no <hi>farther,</hi> then their
<hi>hypocritical pretences,</hi> to help them on; and to pertake of their ſins.</p>

<hi>correct him:</hi> and not let him goe without a ſcourge, being a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of his love, <hi>Heh.</hi> 12.5, 6, 78. This <hi>David</hi> is an eminent example of, he no ſooner <hi>kills <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> but he ſmarts for it: His <hi>child</hi> dyes, His Son <hi>Amon</hi> is ſlain, and

<hi>chaſtiſ'd,</hi> I ſhall not ſtand upon <hi>many:</hi> The very frame of the Covenant of grace ſufficiently beſpeakes it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it is no ſtrange matter for a <hi>David</hi> to be
<hi>plagued</hi> and <hi>ſcourged:</hi> but that he ſhould feel theſe ſtroakes <hi>all the day long and every morning;</hi> This ſeemes ſomewhat <hi>extraordinary:</hi> not unlike his other complaint <hi>day and night thy hand was heavy upon me.

                  <p>For although every good Man hath his <hi>ſhare</hi> of chaſtiſment, yet ordinarily it is with <hi>viciſſitudes</hi> and ſome

<hi>their</hi> high lookt <pb n="98" facs="tcp:170403:73"/> fortunes could not make him, according to the fawning, <hi>ſervile, cuſtome</hi> of the World,
<hi>comply</hi> with <hi>them:</hi> nor was he moved by their pernicious

                  </p>
                  <p>But to deſcend to particulars: The Prophet here deſcribes his <hi>Religion,</hi>

                  <p>And by this of a pure, upright, perfect heart; true

                  <p n="1">1. We cannot rationally conceive that God in acts of

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170403:73"/> 
                     <hi>there be not a thought in thy wicked heart againſt thy poor Brother, is an often repeated precept. Deut.</hi> 15.6. <hi>Deviſe not evil againſt thy neighbour</hi> is the wiſe mans advice.

                  <p>Nor ſecondly can the reaſon be that <hi>the heart</hi> when

                  </p>
                  <p>But poſitively the reaſons are. 1. Becauſe the ſin of

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prophet</hi> therefore in <hi>oppoſition to theſe</hi> and to teſtify how <hi>far</hi> he was from their temper, expreſſes the Religious <hi>integrity</hi> of the ſoul <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God</hi> by <hi>the cleanſing of the heart:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible for him to be an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> whoſe complexion is <hi>ſo innocent, whoſe heart is clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is very obſervable that there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between acts of <hi>Piety</hi> and acts of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> both in the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>acceptance</hi> by

                  <p>But in our demeanour <hi>towards God and in that</hi> which concernes <hi>his worſhip,</hi> it comes more home. <hi>His Law</hi> is ſpiritual; and his all ſeeing eye reaches the moſt inward diſpoſition of <hi>the heart</hi> as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures <hi>Samuel</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, Amongſt thoſe many evils which attend upon in juſtice, it is one, that <hi>guilty hands</hi> can never tender an offering acceptable to God. <hi>I will not heare; their hands are full of Blood.</hi> Iſa. 1.15. <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is in vaine</hi> unleſſe there be made a

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:170403:79"/>As therefore a greater diſcontent cannot befall any, then to find his ſervice diſaccepted, (this forc't

                  <p>THE occaſion of the offence taken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet hath been diſpatcht; and we found that it fully conſiſted and was made up of two things: 1. The wickeds proſperity notwithſtanding their corrupt and impious

<hi>piety</hi> and <hi>Innocence.</hi> Both theſe (I ſay) concurr'd to make up the <hi>offence</hi> taken. He would not be offended at their
<hi>Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he had been proſperous too:</hi> nor at their
<hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> had he been <hi>like to them.</hi> His own <hi>good courſes</hi> had not given him ſiniſter thoughts, had they <hi>freed</hi> him from <hi>diſtreſſe.</hi> nor his troubles, had his <hi>courſes been ſuch as theirs;</hi> But to ſee <hi>them wicked</hi> and <hi>proſper, Himſelfe righteous</hi> and <hi>ſcourged,</hi> this ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, tempted and offended him.<note place="margin">The temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it ſelfe firſt ſin envy.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Temptation</hi> it ſelfe now follows; the ſins and miſcarriages which he fell into, or was like to be overwhelmed withall, claime our next thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The 1. that appeares is <hi>envy, I was envious at the fooliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rationall Particle <hi>(for) I had well nigh ſlipt, For I was envious</hi> concludes, what eſteem he had of <hi>envy,</hi> as of a
<hi>ſlip;</hi> and may afford us this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Envy whereever it is harboured, is a fall and a bruiſing ſin.</hi> It might be a ſufficient evincement of this truth, to produce that <hi>divine</hi> Law wherein it is <hi>prohibited. Be not envious againſt the workers of Iniquity Pſ.</hi> 37.1. is oft required; and
<hi>this ſin,</hi> the Saints ſtill indeavoured carefully to
<hi>avoid.</hi> But that its corruption may be more diſcernible: It
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170403:81"/> may not be amiſſe to diſſect and open it by parts.</p>
                  <p>This Caution may be onely premiſed, That whereas in <hi>envy there is the riſing of the heart with diſpleaſure:</hi> This
<hi>abſolutely</hi> and abſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is not the ſinne thereof, becauſe there may be a <hi>riſing of the heart,</hi> and this accompanied with <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> with <hi>Hatred</hi> and

                     <note place="margin">The ſecond ſin to think Religion vaine.</note>The ſecond ſin the Prophet was tempted unto, was to ſay and think <hi>That his religion and Innocence were vaine</hi> and to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Men are apt to come to this height. <hi>What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? Job.</hi> 21.14, 15. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted and thou ſeeſt not? Iſ.</hi> 58.2, 3. <hi>Ye have ſaid it is vaine to ſerve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hoſts? and now we call the proud happy, yea they that work wickedneſſe are ſet up, yea they that Tempt God are often delivered. Malach.</hi> 3.15. This then was the maine temptation here, to <hi>think</hi> (and conclude in his heart) That <hi>all his devotion</hi> and <hi>ſervice of God,</hi> all his
<hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> towards man was
<hi>Vaine;</hi> without any Profit for the <hi>preſent,</hi> or expectation for the <hi>future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the danger of this Temptation, and the greatneſſe of this ſin may appeare, we may obſerve</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Prophet calls this a <hi>Species</hi> of the
<hi>failing of his ſteps, and the ſliding of his feet.</hi> And well might he terme it ſo; for without great <hi>Ignorance</hi> and blindneſſe of the <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> without high corruption of <hi>Judgement</hi> and predominancy of <hi>errour</hi> and paſſion, it cannot be thought or ſaid that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>obedience to God is vaine.</hi> For of ſuch men who are infected with <hi>theſe thoughts</hi> (and it is to be feared too many in theſe times have yeilded thereto) &amp; been carried away therewith, I would fairely and rationally demand whether they doe firmely believe <hi>there is a God, or not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170403:83"/>1. If they <hi>doe not;</hi> they are not worthy of any rationall diſcourſe, as denying <hi>received principles;</hi> However for the <hi>matter</hi> in Queſtion, the ſtrength of <hi>this cauſe</hi> is ſuch, as that they may be convinced, though we ſhould ſuppoſe there were <hi>no God,</hi> and that the precepts of Religion were the meer Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men.</p>
                  <p>Let them Imagine with me, That men would, as they are
<hi>reaſonable,</hi> wholly bend themſelves to follow theſe precepts of nature, and reaſon. That no Magiſtrate would uſe his <hi>power,</hi> to the <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and grieving of his ſubject. That the ſubject would yeild all <hi>lawfull</hi> and cheerefull obedience, to Authority, and both concur to ſtrengthen and countenance each other, ſuppoſe
<hi>States</hi> would not for intereſt, and ambition Incroach upon; or invade
<hi>each the</hi> other. That in <hi>common wealths</hi> juſt Laws might be the rule. That in Families Conjugall love were preſerved; and the mutuall duties of Parent and children, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and ſervants obſerved.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>private Perſons;</hi> That they would abſtaine from oppreſſions, covetouſneſſe, and Revenge; <hi>doing as they would be done by.</hi> That the ſecond Table of the Morall Law were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervantly ſtuck unto. If (I ſay) all this (which is in it ſelfe not unimaginable nor carries an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,) were duly followed, would not mutuall love be continued? would not all things turne to the cheerfull ſupport of each other? would not out of this pleaſing harmony, <hi>Peace, Plenty</hi> and Proſperity ariſe, as Naturally, neceſſarily and inevitably, as light from the ſun warmth <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170403:84"/> from fire and fruits from the ſeaſonable Influences of Heaven. Nay more certainly then health, from the obſervance of a <hi>tempered</hi> diet. for 1. Though a good diet may preſerve, from inward diſtempers, and diſeaſes, yet it cannot defend from outward Heat, cold and theſe other unuſuall aſſaults. Whence Juſtice and Innocency in a Kingdome keeps ſafe from all. 2. The Body (upon the <hi>contrariety</hi> of <hi>principles</hi> to each other) doth naturally waſt; whereas the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and
<hi>Innocency,</hi> are conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and ſubordinate, and being in a laſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity as being <hi>Truths</hi> that are immortall.</p>
                  <p>If theſe men would but rationally examine from what coaſt all calamities and troubles do fly; They might eaſily find they iſſue out of diviſion and warrs, Civil and Forreigne; and whence do warrs? but from thoſe inordinate luſts which violating and diſobeying the law of Juſtice, act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Nature</hi> and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Thus though men ſhould ariſe to that height, as to deny Providence; yet cleare experience, and undeniable demonſtration manifeſts that it is not in <hi>vaine,</hi> to cleanſe the heart, and <hi>waſh the hands in Innocency.</hi> Nay that this will exceedingly conduce unto Peace, proſperity, and fullneſſe of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall happineſſe; it being irrationall to but imagine the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And whereas too many with the Prophet here malecontent; may ſay that they disbelieve not <hi>that there is a God;</hi> but onely <hi>what profit is there in the ſervice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be returned. If God be not a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that ſerve him</hi> whether is it ſo, becauſe he cannot or will not? He that affirmes <pb n="121" facs="tcp:170403:84"/> he <hi>cannot;</hi> derogates from his
<hi>Omnipotency;</hi> and ſo denyes what he ſay's he <hi>beleeves:</hi> for he cannot <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve a God that denies his power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſecondly that affirmes <hi>God will not.</hi> 1. Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes not to God <hi>that Juſtice</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> which many <hi>men</hi> are indowed with: for Men, commonly in gratitude
<hi>love them</hi> that are <hi>reſpectfull,</hi> and requite <hi>good</hi> for <hi>good;</hi> can any in reaſon or Juſtice, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>meaner thoughts of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>charges God with breach</hi> of promiſe; for in the <hi>ſame word,</hi> where he hath ſo fully revealed himſelfe; and wherein he commands, <hi>holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and righteouſneſſe, he hath openly <hi>ingaged,</hi> to <hi>honour</hi> them that <hi>honour</hi> him, to
<hi>reward</hi> thoſe, that <hi>love and feare him.</hi> And whatever the thoughts of men are; he is immutably faithfull; and inviolably keeps his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee may perceive how many <hi>unreaſonable abſurdities</hi> they fall into, how groſly they thwart the principles of their owne reaſon and beleef; that ſay, <hi>Religion is in vaine,</hi> and well may the Prophet in this conceite, acknowledge himſelf <hi>a fool,</hi> and a <hi>beaſt, V.</hi> 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant, I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proceed: we may obſerve ſecondly, That the Prophet expreſſes this <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> by the notion of a
<hi>fall, well nigh gone, my ſteps ſlipt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which in this matter he might well ſay: <hi>For a man that underſtands not, becomes like the beast. Pſal.</hi> 40.20. He looſeth himſelfe and turnes Brutiſh, which in this caſe two reſpects make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. 1. In reſpect of <hi>courſe of life.</hi> 2. <hi>Of comfort and content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:170403:85"/>For the firſt: It is obſervable that man is in his ſoul (like to the <hi>heavens</hi>) ever <hi>in motion,</hi> and that to <hi>profit.</hi> There is in him a deſire of <hi>wel-being</hi> which is ever reſtleſſe, from the ſeeking after which he can no more command himſelf then a ſtone reſt in the aire forgetting it's center. His ſoul muſt be ſtill work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out its beſt profit and advantage.</p>
                  <p>When therefore his <hi>underſtanding</hi> and
<hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are <hi>ſo corrupt</hi> that he thinks <hi>piety</hi> and
<hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is not the way to his profit and happineſſe; it muſt follow that he will zealouſly indeavour to bring his ends about by the breach and neglect of all Laws humane and Divine; That he licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly devote himſelf to <hi>impiety</hi> and injuſtice; And not ſtick at any thing right or wrong for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And ſo becomes highly odious to God and injurious and cruel towards man; and unfit for humane ſociety.</p>
                  <p>As a man looſeth himſelf <hi>in his courſe of Life,</hi> by thinking <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>Innocence</hi> vaine: So ſecondly he
<hi>looſeth</hi> himſelf in reſpect of <hi>comfort</hi> and content, for by the intervenement of this wild conceit he <hi>falls</hi> from his
<hi>beſt</hi> hopes and moſt <hi>rationall</hi> comforts. For if in
<hi>this life</hi> onely <hi>we have hopes we</hi> are moſt
<hi>miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. Although Man injoys what ever the World can yeeld; yet he will at length finde all experimentally to be but
<hi>vanity,</hi> and his unſatisfied heart will throw all away with a
<hi>vexation</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: what comfort therefore and contentment can ſurvive in him, whoſe hope can goe no further? Purer ſouls do know that
<hi>Innocency</hi> of a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> and <hi>preſent</hi> hopes of future happineſſe <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> by God, that (in ſumme) in God and in his word is mans beſt comfort which he <hi>looſeth</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170403:85"/> himſelf of, that thinks Religion vaine, and the fear of God unprofitable; and ſo becomes Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh indeed <hi>living onely by ſenſe &amp; dying without hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>we may</hi> ſee into how <hi>great</hi> a ſin and
<hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation</hi> the Prophet had like to make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack againſt. And a ſerious reflexion upon this diſcourſe may animate us to a more then ordinary watch upon our Spirits; to ſtop the admiſſion of ſo <hi>deſperate monſtrous and unreaſonable</hi> a thought as this is; and for the greater diligence we may <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> that <hi>theſe</hi> are the times wherein this <hi>temptation</hi> gathers <hi>head,</hi> and do's more boldly make it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. If <hi>proſperity</hi> ever vouchſafe to reflect <hi>upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> it will be with ſome good thoughts; as that it <hi>deſerves no leſſe:</hi> but <hi>Calamity</hi> is the time of this <hi>temptation;</hi> when the <hi>Prophet</hi> was <hi>ſcourged</hi> and
<hi>plagued,</hi> then he grew into <hi>theſe</hi> melancholy thoughts. And theſe being darke, clowdy, diſmal, confuſed times; let every conſcientious ſoul take heed of this dangerous pitfal.</p>
                  <p>And to this end that our eſteem of Piety and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence may be the better fortified.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the <hi>power</hi> of God, <hi>able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> For I know <hi>and am perſwaded</hi> that he is able. 2

                  <p>The <hi>dangerous ſin and Temptation which</hi> the Prophet was like to fall into being already run through; Now we come to the ſecond part of the Pſalme, wherein we may take a view of thoſe <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py meanes</hi> whereby the <hi>Prophet,</hi> (thus intangled, got out of
<hi>theſe Briars;</hi> avoided <hi>the ſins,</hi> and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſo great a fall, and ſo <hi>perilous a Temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which point, Method, and diſtinction may preſent unto us theſe 2. particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which made him ſtartle, and to be at a
<hi>ſtand, ſo</hi> as he durſt make no <hi>farther</hi> progreſſe into ſo deſperate a thought. 2. <hi>That</hi> which cleared all
<hi>miſts,</hi> took away all objections, ſet him on his feet;
<hi>held,</hi> and <hi>confirm'd</hi> him in an upright walke.</p>
                  <p>The former (namely that, which checkt his <hi>looſe</hi> and evil thoughts) is contained in the 1. verſe. <hi>If I ſay I will ſpeak thus, behold I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy Children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of which we ſhall briefly expound the termes and then proceed to the matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy Children;</hi> this is an <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> unto God, and the Children meant here are <hi>his;</hi> Thoſe whom in the 1. verſe, <hi>He termed Iſrael, of a clean heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of which expreſſion is; That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe many <hi>high titles</hi> given to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this is one which he vouchſafes unto <pb n="125" facs="tcp:170403:86"/> them; that he cals them
<hi>his Sons, Children, and firſt borne, Deut.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
1.2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.1. Hence it is that being the
<hi>whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was termed ſo; That they in that Nation that were truly <hi>Religious,</hi> were eſpecially honoured, with this title of which the Apoſtle aſſures <hi>us Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>In the New Teſtament, <hi>this Prerogative</hi> is every where more frequently mentioned; and the grounds, and reaſons thereof more fully, plainly, and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared. As 1. that the foundation of mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Children</hi> of God, is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the onely begotten Son of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. 2. For <hi>the ſeed</hi> of this regeneration, that is <hi>the word,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being borne againe not of corruptible ſeed, but of the incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi>
3. <hi>The means on our part is Baptiſme and faith in Chriſt. Joh.</hi> 1.
<hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Generation</hi> here is taken for a multitude of men, <hi>unâ eademque aetate viventibus; contemporary.</hi> The Prophet do's not ingroſs <hi>Piety</hi> to himſelf alone; but acknowledges others feared God beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                  <p>But ſtill a convenient <hi>circumſtance</hi> muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the action: for though the thing be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> yet the manner of doing may ſpoile amd deforme it.

                  <p>This Rule may be very ſerviceable to the caſe in hand.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, in caſe a truth ſhould be revealed, which ſeems <hi>new;</hi> which hath not been received in the <hi>Church,</hi> nor explained in the <hi>Articles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a man muſt not preſently vent it in the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> or diſturbe the Churches Peace; for this were offenſive and would tend to a <hi>Rent,</hi> but he muſt modeſtly expect a ſeaſonable occaſion wherein he may deliver his minde, and open his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For where a Church is eſtabliſhed, with all things
<hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> there its Unity and Peace is to be preferred, before a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>farther</hi> Knowledge; though it be a divine truth. The Apoſtles <hi>Preſcription</hi> to the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> ought to be our <hi>Patterne</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29,

                  <p>Secondly, in the delivery of doctrines revealed and eſtabliſhed, New, uncouth, harſh Phraſes, or liable to exception, either for novelty or for affinity unto errours muſt be avoided.

                     <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> is twofold; the one
<hi>Neceſſary,</hi> the other <hi>Indifferent. Neceſſary Christian liberty</hi> is That which a <hi>man is bound to make uſe of as liberty from circumciſion,</hi> from legall ceremonies, New moones and its feaſts; from Tying Gods worſhip to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> only which the <hi>Jewes</hi> conceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <pb n="139" facs="tcp:170403:93"/> obliged unto. Such is the liberty of <hi>Marriage</hi> for all ſorts, not being bound to abſtaine from ſuch and ſuch ſorts of meate.</p>
                  <p>This kind of liberty is alwaies to be carefully preſerved in the <hi>Church</hi> and they who would faſten the Jewiſh yoake on Chriſtians ſhoulders, were <hi>offenſive Act.</hi> 15.10. and therefore the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice concernes us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. <hi>ſtand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free; and be not intangled againe with the yoke of Bondage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Indifferent Chriſtian liberty</hi> is that which a man
<hi>may</hi> or <hi>may not make uſe of:</hi> Thus though the liberty of
<hi>Marriage</hi> be preſerved; yet <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Party may
<hi>abſteine</hi> from it: Though <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that meat</hi> be
<hi>Indifferent;</hi> yet a man may upon ſome eſpeciall occaſion abridge himſelfe thereof. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>All this may be Lawfull, but all things at all times are not expedient.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch things as theſe 1. <hi>Mutuall forbearance</hi> is to <hi>take place,</hi> for otherwiſe, each may prove offenſive to other. Thus they that <hi>Bow</hi> upon their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Church may looke upon others as careleſſe, and irreverent; and they that <hi>bow not,</hi> may think others <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> here a <hi>mutuall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance</hi> may be <hi>beſt.</hi> 2. Mutuall care and reſpect of each other is to be had. 1. Becauſe they that are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> That is more
<hi>confirmed</hi> and have <hi>greater meaſure</hi> of <hi>knowledge,</hi> ought indulgently to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to, and take care of the <hi>weaker,</hi> in abſteining from ſuch things as may offend them. This the Apoſtle carefully diſcourſes of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor. ch.</hi> 8.
<hi>ch.</hi> 10. The ſubject of which are things <hi>Indifferent.</hi> He that looks upon <hi>days</hi> and <hi>meates</hi> as <hi>indifferent</hi> and is aſſured of his <hi>Chriſtian liberty</hi> ought in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170403:94"/> uſe thereof to endeavour 1. That all ſophiſtry and wrangling diſputations be laid aſide. 2. That he contemne not, or imperiouſly inſult over him, who is not fully perſwaded of ſuch liberty. 3. That in the preſence of a weake brother he doe not that which ſhould offend or induce him to do the like; before his conſcience be ſetled and perſwaded.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for thoſe of the weaker conſtitution, that they do not raſhly cenſure and judge others, who in all things conforme not to their humours; It is too oft found that they who pretend to be <hi>weake ones,</hi> and ſubject to be offended; are moſt <hi>ſtrong</hi> and bitter in their uncharitable <hi>cenſures.</hi> Let not him that <hi>eateth not, judge him that eateth.</hi>

<hi>Thy word is truth:</hi> he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>deceive nor be deceived,</hi> and therefore it is moſt ſafe to adhere to his word.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Arguments againſt <hi>fundamentall truths,</hi> may be reduced to theſe two heads: either they are drawn from our not
<hi>comprehending</hi> or underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the true reaſons of that
<hi>Truth,</hi> or from other <hi>croſſe motives,</hi> and diſwaſions.</p>
                     <p>Of the former; <hi>Nicodemus</hi> may be an example who entertaines the myſterious doctrine of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> with a demand
<hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Joh. 3.9. He apprehends not the
<hi>myſterie,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not believe; in this caſe it is mans
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> not Gods <hi>Truth</hi> is in <hi>fault.</hi> A blind man is not excuſed from an untruth in denying the Sun to ſhine becauſe he ſees it not; nor can he be free who denies the Trinity of Perſons, the Deity of Chriſt; the Reſurrection of the dead, (Truths for the

                        <hi>plainly delivered,</hi> and revealed) becauſe he cannot fathome the bottome; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Reaſons of them or how they can be ſo; And therefore we may conclude that <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170403:98"/> it is far more ſafe to relie on God who cannot deceive; then to leane upon our own broken Reeds; to ſtick to our ſelves who may both erre and be
<hi>deceived.</hi>

                     <p>If ſecondly it be not <hi>want of apprehenſion</hi> but
<hi>croſſe arguments</hi> which move us to inferre <hi>concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> contrary to Gods <hi>truth:</hi> theſe two things may be interpoſed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That theſe argmuments are of our own
<hi>coyning</hi> and ſo are but chaines &amp; fetters of our own
<hi>Making</hi> from which if we cannot unwinde our ſelves, the blame muſt lie at our own doores. He who by a pernicious <hi>Cuſtome</hi> contracts upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an habit of <hi>drunkenneſse;</hi> though in reſpect of that
<hi>habit</hi> he ſins <hi>neceſſarily;</hi> and is not eaſily able to leave that vicious deboiſtneſſe yet this ſhall rather <hi>condemne</hi> then excuſe him, in that he hath brought ſo unhappy a neceſſity upon himſelfe. He who binds his own <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> and then caſts himſelfe headlong into the Sea; will not be excuſed by a plea that he was drowned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not ſwim.</p>
                     <p>So when men entertaine <hi>fleſhly</hi> corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and enſnare themſelves therewith, though thus taken they neceſſarily erre: yet can they not be excuſed; ſince they have <hi>framed</hi> the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (wherewith they are chained) for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing which may be offered, is this
<hi>certainty, That all that God reveales being truth, every concluſion contrary thereto, muſt be falſe, and if the concluſion be falſe, the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one or both muſt be ſo too.</hi> Thus as in matters
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170403:98"/> of <hi>Practice,</hi> Gods commands are good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what motives or Arguments ſoever draw us to ſin (though taken from the moſt ſpecious profit, largeſt pleaſure and higheſt
<hi>preferment,</hi> though they ſeem never ſo conformable to our deſires, and maske themſelves under a demure look, yet) they are
<hi>really</hi> and in themſelves <hi>Bad,</hi> and unrighteous; ſo the Arguments proving any Hereſy, though they may appeare in reaſonable colours, and carry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe with them; yet they are <hi>direct untruths</hi> and containe falſehood: as is evident in the caſe in hand: for ſuppoſe the Prophets Argument were thus framed: <hi>If the wicked thrive and good men be afflicted in this life, then Religion is vaine.</hi> But ſo it is &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is not altogether
<hi>True,</hi> for all <hi>wicked men do not thrive;</hi> and for the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> the <hi>conſequence</hi> is wholly
<hi>denyable;</hi> as being falſe for it will not follow that becauſe the
<hi>wicked are exalted</hi> and the good oppreſs't, <hi>Religion is vaine;</hi> but of this more fully hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In a word, the arguments brought againſt any one <hi>article</hi> of the <hi>Creed</hi> (for inſtance) may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily found <hi>falſe</hi> and unreaſonable.</p>
                     <p>And therefore (as is formerly mentioned) Gods truth is a rock, from which neither tempeſts, nor flatteries muſt remove us. <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> is to <hi>beare us out,</hi> and will do it againſt the ſuggeſtions of our own ignorance, or the plauſible
<hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions</hi> of fleſh and blood: and though whilſt we are clouded with a veile of fleſh, we cannot attaine to a full ſatisfaction; yet when that <hi>which is imperfect</hi> ſhall be done away; we ſhall find cauſe of Triumph, that we have taken God <pb n="150" facs="tcp:170403:99"/> upon his

                  <p>For as although he hath fixed an ordinary courſe of

<hi>Abraham,</hi> his intention was no way to <hi>croſſe</hi> the
<hi>ordinary precept,</hi> which <hi>bound him</hi> not in that
<hi>Particular;</hi> he having received <hi>from God</hi> a <hi>command</hi> to
<hi>ſacrifice his Son.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the Prophets taking unto him a <hi>woman of Fornication,</hi> done in a <hi>ſigne</hi> to

                  <p>It may be <hi>anſwered</hi> that <hi>Holy</hi> extraordinary men; (who were honoured with a frequent &amp; extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary converſation;) had <hi>other meanes</hi> beſides the generall revealed <hi>Law of God;</hi> as <hi>dreames, voice, miracles, Revelations, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were infallibly made acquainted with Gods

                     <hi>Deue.</hi> 13.1. &amp;c. and concerning theſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, theſe two obſervations may be taken up as we paſſe along.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That in thoſe times wherein men had ſpeciall Revelation from God; yet in caſes of Gods worſhip, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſſe or oppreſſion, they were not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any Prophet teaching the contrary.</hi> Deutron. chap. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That theſe extraordinary examples were never drawn into ordinary practice amongſt the Iſraelites.</hi> They never thought it <hi>lawfull,</hi> to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> their <hi>children,</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded, to <hi>offer</hi> his Son; nor to

                  <p>Therefore it may highly concerne us not to gape after extraordinaries, or to wander out after pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſuggeſtions; but to ſtick cloſe to Gods <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> And (which follows hence) that we muſt not hope or expect <hi>Gods ſpeciall advice in an evil action, or to look after a direction from Heaven in the comittall of ſin.</hi>

                  <p>In all theſe and the like caſes; a <hi>ſeeking</hi> of

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:170403:131"/>Thus were the <hi>luminaries</hi> created

                  <p>Now amongſt the works of <hi>creation</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Man, <hi>this</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> that there is impreſs't in his

                  <p>Now ſince this is God's work, it is <hi>Good,</hi> and becauſe <hi>good,</hi> not in <hi>vaine;</hi> and therefore we may conclude that <hi>Providence</hi> hath appointed <hi>meanes</hi> and chalked out waies, for mans attaining to, and enjoying of that which ſhall make him

                  </p>
                  <p>We anſwer that <hi>Providence</hi> undertakes not for the

                  <p>So though <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> ſoule (having a naturall deſire of bleſſedneſſe) <hi>faile thereof,</hi> yet is it not in <hi>vaine:</hi> if one <hi>ſoule</hi> attaines the <hi>end,</hi> Providence anſwers the Creature: and ſhews this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> is
<hi>attainable;</hi> nor is it engaged, to bring <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> ſoule to happineſſe, more then <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Plant to perfection; becauſe that unto attainment of <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> man, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more required then a <hi>meer</hi> deſire of

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet, as <hi>Providence</hi> workes the preſervation of Nature, by influence upon <hi>individualls:</hi> ſo doth Providence ſhew its infallible <hi>Coreſpondence</hi> with this deſire of

                  <p>And further, as in Nature every <hi>Individual</hi> would certainly produce its <hi>naturall actions</hi> unto full extent; if not

                  </p>
                  <p>Now mans workes are of <hi>great variety,</hi> amongſt which thoſe properly, are the objects of juſtice which are 1. Morally

                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſome men give themſelves wholy to the

                  </p>
                  <p>Now farther that God is <hi>Providentially juſt,</hi> that he takes notice of the <hi>actions</hi> of men, that he put <pb n="217" facs="tcp:170403:132"/> a <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>them,</hi> and renders accordingly, <hi>two things</hi> (amongſt many) fully evince.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is ſuch a <hi>vertue as this</hi> amongſt men; which bears not its ſelfe <hi>alike to all agents;</hi> but

<hi>in God,</hi> (who is all <hi>ſufficient,</hi>) there being no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the <hi>Creature</hi> which is not <hi>infinitly in God,</hi> and derived
<hi>from him;</hi> and therefore we cannot (in reaſon) conceive, or expect, he ſhould <hi>be alike to all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The experience and teſtimony of <hi>all ages;</hi> which give us abundant <hi>examples,</hi> of the viſible, notorious,

<hi>bleſſings</hi> upon ſome, that have been his <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> and the ſame Hiſtory and experience tells us, of ſome (yea thouſands) that not onely receive not their <hi>reward,</hi> but are porſecuted, afflicted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. <hi>and others had tryall of cruell mockings, and ſcourgings yea moreover of bonds and impriſonment.</hi> Sealing their faith and obedience with that
<hi>blood,</hi> which they cheerfully poured out, as a tribute of their
<hi>hopes,</hi> and a witneſſe of their more <hi>glorious</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. It being a <hi>certaine</hi> and infallible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; That being, there is a God, which <hi>Judgeth the Earth, there is verily likewiſe, a <pb n="218" facs="tcp:170403:133"/> reward</hi> for the <hi>righteous,</hi> which the Apoſtle was ſure of, when hee tells us, 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be objected; that it is rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable, that man might <hi>do all this without reward;</hi> becauſe God may command without propoſing of a <hi>reward,</hi> and man (in <hi>reaſon</hi>) ought to obey though there <hi>be none.</hi> I anſwer 'tis true indeed, but yet ſince God hath ſo manifeſtly declared himſelf juſt, ſo as none that beleeves a <hi>God,</hi> disbeleeves his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and his
<hi>Juſtice</hi> is, in <hi>rewarding</hi> the <hi>good,</hi> as well as
<hi>puniſhing</hi> the <hi>evil</hi> doers; it followes that <hi>as ſure as God is juſt, if well doers have not their reward in this life,</hi> they ſhall have <hi>it after.</hi> So on the <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide:</hi> the
<hi>wicked</hi> that <hi>eſcape</hi> their <hi>puniſhment here</hi> ſhall meet <hi>with it hereafter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be further objected: <hi>this</hi> may ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in the behalf of ſuch <hi>good men,</hi> as ſuffer for
<hi>righteouſneſſe ſake;</hi> but what ſhall we ſay of them, that enjoy their portion in this life; as did <hi>Joſuah</hi> and many other powerful and famous men.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, God indeed is <hi>debtor</hi> to none; the
<hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> received in <hi>this life,</hi> are <hi>more</hi> then can <hi>be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved</hi> and yet they come far ſhort of <hi>true,</hi> and full <hi>bleſsedneſse:</hi> which is not to be found here below; nor will the bleſſings, they receive in <hi>this life,</hi> more prevent a more full and <hi>future</hi> felicity; then in joying the <hi>firſt fruits,</hi> debars the reaping of a <hi>full harveſt.

                  <p n="1">1. That it may be known, there is juſt cauſe to
<hi>fear and tremble at the disbeleif of this point,</hi> the <hi>grounds of this faer</hi> (as may be collected from what hath been delivered) are
<hi>two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<hi>gainſayes</hi> his reſurrection; and takes away all <hi>hope,</hi> and
<hi>fear</hi> of <hi>future Judgment, and overthrows all Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>disbeleif</hi> is the more <hi>fearfull</hi> by how <pb n="232" facs="tcp:170403:140"/> much more it is <hi>inexcuſable;</hi> and how

                     <hi>converſion</hi> and regeneration muſt go before <hi>Glory,</hi> is made evident to us

                  <p>Secondly, unto <hi>Glory</hi> it is requiſite that there be a
<hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> from the grave and the power of death; of which the Apoſtle gives us a large account. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. from whence obſerve</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That though the ſoule live after death, yet can we not properly ſay the <hi>whole perſon is in glory,</hi> whilſt the
<hi>body</hi> is in the <hi>grave;</hi> and ſees corruption. Now <hi>glory is promiſed to the whole perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly Though the ſoule be capable of a <hi>better well being</hi> in Heaven, then this <hi>life</hi> can afford; yet is it not in its perfect and compleat <hi>eſtate</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>body;</hi> as having a naturall <hi>deſire</hi> and inclination to be united to it: wherein as it had <pb n="240" facs="tcp:170403:144"/> its firſt being; ſo with it, it deſires ſtil to be.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>laſting dominion</hi> of <hi>death</hi> was brought in by <hi>ſin;</hi> and till all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin be done away, there cannot be <hi>full glory</hi> and therefore man cannot be compleatly happy, till he can triumphantly ſay <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there is no worke nor <hi>wiſdome</hi> in the
<hi>grave,</hi> when man returnes to his duſt againe, the body ſubmits to a diſſolution, and enlivens that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dishonour it was borne to; This is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion totall, from which no returne can be made by mans own efficiency, for how can he revive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that is altogether
<hi>liveleſſe,</hi> or act to his own recovery, that is inſenſible and moveleſſe in this; then is man a mere <hi>paſſive receiver.</hi> And thus much of the firſt reaſon.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170403:145"/>And indeed ſome have gon beyond imagination and <hi>fancy,</hi> even to a <hi>full perſwaſion;</hi> the Phariſees had a high opinion of themſelves, and were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of the worth of their <hi>own righteouſneſſe,</hi> ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying themſelves
<hi>above other men,</hi> as the onely <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious favorites</hi> of heaven.</p>
                  <p>To them and their <hi>high</hi> thoughts have ſucceeded

<hi>others</hi> is too confidently preſumed on.</p>
                  <p>If the opinion of theſe men be true, they are very
<hi>active</hi> and <hi>effectuall agents</hi> in their own Salvation: and that in ſuch an efficiency, as gives <hi>neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> in this caſe eſpecially. For it is not with God, as with man; man many times
<hi>ſees</hi> not <hi>worth,</hi> or cannot <hi>judge</hi> of it, or out of partiality, commonly neglects it: God cannot do ſo, where <hi>merit</hi> is He cannot but <hi>ſee it;</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> aright concerning it, and conſequently do <hi>to it as it deſerves.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That this is ſo, is clearly proved by the words of our

                  <p n="3">3. I add, that our <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> is but
<hi>imperfect,</hi> and whilſt we are in this world, how ſubject to failings? how full of defects? inſomuch that every day we have occaſion to ſay, not only <hi>humiliter humbly</hi> (as <hi>Pelagius</hi> his gloſſ was,) but <hi>veraciter truly; Forgive us our ſins.</hi>

                  <p>He denies not, but that in the Creatures there is, and may be

<hi>poſſible to be enjoyed by him.</hi> Though he <hi>rejects not the knowledge of nature,</hi> the <hi>contemplation</hi> of the Heavens; and it's illuſtrious furniture, the glorious productions of omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; or any other
<hi>ſcience,</hi> that might adorne his nature; yet he paſſionately prizes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of the onely true God above all.</hi> Though he refuſes not the benefits the Creatures reach him, yet he uſes the World, without confiding in it; Gods <hi>goodneſſe</hi> being the chief
<hi>object</hi> of his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>choice;</hi> though he diſdaines not the <hi>the ordinances of men,</hi> yet he counts it better to <hi>obey God;</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>his Commandments,</hi> for the <hi>rule</hi> of his

                  </p>
                  <p>And this indeed is that which the true Servants of God have ever really profeſſed, and zealouſly declared. <hi>Abraham</hi> made

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor yet muſt he think <hi>this,</hi> a matter arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: We have a <hi>command</hi> of exalting the Lord above all. <hi>Exalt the Lord and worſhip all his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, Pſal.</hi> 99. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.

<hi>verſ.</hi> 37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is reaſon for it, becauſe there is
<hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> in the Creature <hi>deſirable,</hi> which is not in God in an <hi>infinitely-full, eminent</hi> manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>unto all perfection;</hi> nay there is no Creature, though <hi>never ſo lovely,</hi> that can <hi>fill the deſires</hi> of the ſoul; but God is, and hath all, that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>ſatisfy,</hi> unto all fulneſſe of

                  <p>That the love, or <hi>deſire</hi> of man is ſet upon many objects in a double manner.</p>

<hi>one</hi> for the <hi>other,</hi> but each of them for <hi>ſeveral reaſons, more or leſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Dependently,</hi> when a man <hi>doth love</hi> or
<hi>deſire,</hi> one <hi>thing firſt,</hi> and <hi>other things</hi> in
<hi>relation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and <hi>becauſe of it.</hi> Thus the ſame
<hi>David</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> for <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſake; and <hi>Abiathar</hi> for his <hi>Fathers.</hi> Now a true Servant of God, doth not <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>love God</hi> and other things, with a love of
<hi>independency,</hi> that is God for <hi>himſelf,</hi> and other
<hi>enjoyments</hi> for <hi>themſelves.</hi> But firſt the <hi>love of God</hi> is ſhed abroad in his heart; and from <hi>thence,</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to <hi>others.</hi> (like rivulets, that pleaſingly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from their ſpring) affects <hi>other things in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> to <hi>the love</hi> he bears <hi>to God,</hi> and for his ſake, as the things <hi>loved</hi> or deſired, have <hi>relation unto him:</hi> namely as they are <hi>gifts of God</hi> diſpenſed in providence for our comfort, or as they are ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable to his glory, or <hi>as</hi> he hath put a relation upon them unto us, and founded the ſame in our neceſſities, (as food) or in our nature, (as are our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,) or in his <hi>owne ordinances</hi> (as marriage and Magiſtracy) or in the bleſſings by him diſpenſed by
<hi>their means,</hi> or <hi>laſtly</hi> in his own <hi>will</hi> or
<hi>command;</hi> or in any or all <hi>theſe</hi> put together.</p>
                  <p>And that the Saints of God do <hi>love</hi> all things in God, and <hi>nothing but in dependence</hi> to that <hi>love and relation unto him;</hi> is fully evident by this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. That when <hi>this relation</hi> of the <hi>object</hi> unto <hi>God ceaſeth,</hi> and when love cannot have footing in ſuch <hi>dependence</hi> and <hi>relation;</hi> then
<hi>love, deſire,</hi> and the expreſſions thereof do likewiſe
<hi>ceaſe; as if it be not Gods gift,</hi> or cannot <hi>be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; if it make not for his glory,</hi> or <hi>he forbid it,</hi>
                     <pb n="263" facs="tcp:170403:155"/> 
                     <hi>if it ſhould be an occaſion of withdrawing their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> from that love, and duty they owe unto God. <hi>Job hated not his wife,</hi> yet when ſhee tempted him to ſo high and ungratefull a crime as to <hi>curſe God,</hi> he then teſtifies his diſaffection and diſlike, by giving her the juſt character of a <hi>fooliſh Woman.</hi> The many injuries <hi>David</hi> received from <hi>Saul</hi> might well have tempted his revenge to a full execution, when he had him at an advantage; but the very thought and memory of his <hi>relation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> in being
<hi>his anointed,</hi> locked up all his reſentments; and he no longer lookes upon him as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, but as a perſon <hi>more ſacred and inviolable.</hi> Nor had the primitive Chriſtians any great reaſon, to
<hi>love</hi> their cruell, Idolatrous perſecutors, whoſe fury was not ſatisfied with whole ſacrifices of their Bodies, in ſtead of
<hi>Rebelling,</hi> they <hi>releeve</hi> their <hi>Emperours,</hi> bury the dead, and returne their Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick perſecutors offices of <hi>love,</hi> and all, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they had to God. The powers that were, were his ordinance, and both they and their Enemies were enliſted together by Chriſt, within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of that <hi>love,</hi> which men are obliged by to bear and <hi>expreſſe</hi> to one another.</p>
                  <p>And this is farther obſerveable, <hi>in that league</hi> which
<hi>Joſuah</hi> made with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> which (though it ſeemed to carry <hi>many flawes in it,</hi> as, being <hi>made without</hi> any

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170403:156"/> it; and that 1. becauſe it was done by
<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuah,</hi> and advice of the <hi>Princes</hi> whom God had placed in
<hi>Authority,</hi> and to whom he had given commiſſion for the management of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>war.</hi> 2ly. It was a <hi>Peace</hi> confirmed by
<hi>an oath</hi> before <hi>the Lord:</hi> So that now, <hi>God had relation</hi> thereto, and was a <hi>witneſſe</hi> thereof; which quickly ſatisfied their reſentment; and diſarmed their mutinous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in humbler ſubmiſſions.</p>
                  <p>By all which teſtimonies it is abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the <hi>Saints love God firſt; and all other things in reference onely, and ſubordination unto him.</hi> Give me leave now to recollect a little what hath been ſpoken; and preſent you in ſhort with the three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why the Saints upon Earth may be truly ſaid to <hi>chuſe God alone, with utter refuſall of all other things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they make <hi>God the ſole object</hi> of their <hi>deſire, properly and cheifly deſiring to have him alone.</hi> 2.
<hi>Becauſe that every thing that is loved, is loved</hi> in ſubordination to this love of him. 3. (Which followes from hence) becauſe the <hi>love of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> then <hi>ceaſeth,</hi> when it conſiſts not with the
<hi>love of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by theſe three particulars, may every man examine the ſincerity of his heart, and the <hi>truth</hi> of his <hi>love</hi> to God; if thou <hi>loveſt</hi> him <hi>ſo,</hi> as that thou <hi>deſireſt nothing in Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Earth beſides him,</hi> if thy affections to all other objects, be with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> and <hi>ſubordination</hi> of thy <hi>love to him;</hi> if, for his ſake, thou canſt relinquiſh
<hi>all</hi> that thou calleſt <hi>thine;</hi> and nobly <hi>throw away</hi> whatſoever is moſt pleaſing to thee, <hi>for him.</hi> But, if, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the mode of the World) thou runneſt with <pb n="265" facs="tcp:170403:156"/> open armes after its enjoyments; and for a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruition, ar't careleſſe of thy God; or if though thou loveſt him, yet if thy love of Him, and other things, (like <hi>two rivers</hi> from diverſe fountaines) be but ſeparated

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this point with this one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more.<note place="margin">The juſtice and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> That the Commandement in theſe three particulars, is Conſonant unto all juſtice and reaſon, it is as <hi>Righteous,</hi> as it is expreſſe and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, the command of making <hi>God alone</hi> the

                  </p>
                  <p>And the reaſon hereof is likewiſe powerfull. For 1. When other things <hi>without Him</hi> are deſired; they ſhall never be able to ſatisfy the ſoule; but God <hi>can.</hi> 2. Since <hi>deſire</hi> is the

<hi>help</hi> to labouring nature; whoſe blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours otherwiſe would heat and putrify to the the danger of life. Thus whilſt we are here breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after God, if our <hi>deſires</hi> and <hi>anxieties</hi> (which iſſue from our longing after the injoyment of him) be utterly
<hi>ſtopt,</hi> and taken <hi>away</hi> as to that <hi>object,</hi> they will ſoon have recourſe to ſome other, and as a fountaine whoſe ſtreames are put to a ſtand; goes back, and ſetling on its own lees at length putrifies; ſo would our affections &amp; deſires <hi>draw back</hi> &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>worldly objects,</hi> would eaſily contract corruption by this intermixture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did a pure Chriſtian ſoul well examine its own temper, it would not wiſh to be freed from <hi>Anxious longing deſires</hi> after God.</p>
                  <p>But although the remedy here preſcribed doth not abſolutely take off all <hi>anxiety,</hi> yet it makes theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall high advantages.</p>

<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. yet) nature, reaſon, and tradition told them, fornication was <hi>unlawfull,</hi> and <hi>adultery intollerable;</hi> ſo did the

                  <p>It may be anſwered, that in the deſpenſation made in the

                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>ground for this</hi> compariſon, there is evident a great ſimilitude between <hi>both.</hi>

<hi>practical;</hi> That is a <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of <hi>judgment,</hi> and

                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:170403:172"/>If we take all in the <hi>groſſe,</hi> firſt we may view the whole reſolution turnes it's face upon God, and is intirely taken up, in an heavenly carriage, and right deportment towards him; from whence we may gather that ſingular benefit, which flows from the Meditation, and obſervance of Gods providential <hi>Actions,</hi> &amp; merciful relations to <hi>mans ſoul</hi> for from a ſerious conſideration, that God <hi>is his portion and ſtrength, that they periſh and ſhall be deſtroyed, that are far from God, and goe a whoring from him:</hi> There immediately reſults, this reſolution; <hi>But it is good for me to draw neer to God,</hi> &amp;c. And the like will eaſily be rais'd up in us too, if with a reflecting eye, we do but marke the occurring providences to <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad;</hi> if in our owne lives we meditate upon thoſe various mercies &amp; patient forbearances, uſed to us; we ſhould eaſily be inlivened to an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of love, and feele an influence animating our ſouls, to <hi>good reſolutions</hi> and heavenly performances.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject of the firſt reſolution here, is <hi>drawing neer unto God.</hi> Which is properly an <hi>acceſſe</hi> and
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> and heart to God. Which <hi>how</hi> it is made, and by <hi>what meanes</hi> performed, is diſcerned by the
<hi>contrary</hi> thereto, (<hi>going far from God</hi> already ſpoken of) for as the <hi>nature of ſin,</hi> informes us, of <hi>true holineſſe,</hi> by <hi>darkneſſe</hi> we may conceive what is
<hi>light;</hi> as by a deſcription of the <hi>paines</hi> of Hell, the joyes of heaven may be contemplated on; ſo, by the former diſcourſe of going
<hi>far from God,</hi> we may apprehend what it is, to <hi>draw neer</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How good men draw neer to God.</note>This (to be breef) is done by <hi>a conformity of our will, and actions to the Law of God. Hence righteous men as</hi> Enoch, Noah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſaid,
<hi>to have walkt with God.</hi>

<hi>obedient People</hi> making up one <hi>body,</hi> it being Rebellion only that makes them <hi>Two.</hi> 3. They are <hi>neer</hi> in the cheerfull

                     <hi>It is Good</hi> (ſath the Prophet) and <hi>Good for me,</hi> every one of us may find a peculiar ſhare in this

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good</hi> is oppoſed to the <hi>evill</hi> of ſin, and to the <hi>evill</hi> of calamity. In both kindes it is <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That we</hi> eſteem <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> which carries a conſonancy to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>right reaſon.</hi> In
<hi>this Approach</hi> there is true <hi>Judgement,</hi> here there is no
<hi>failing</hi> or <hi>deceit;</hi> and in Reaſon <pb n="298" facs="tcp:170403:173"/> whome can the creature better <hi>draw nigh unto</hi> then its maker; or a Son, then to his indulgent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or the <hi>ſheep</hi> but to the protection of their <hi>ſhepheard;</hi> under whoſe wing can we ſhelter our being, with better ſecurity then his, who <hi>gave it to us?</hi> 2. That is lookt upon as <hi>good</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Gods commandement,</hi> which is abſolutely <hi>Holy, Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> Rom. 7. and this is ſuch, <hi>Come unto me.</hi> Math. 11.28. <hi>draw nigh unto God, Iam.</hi>
4.8. Thirdly, that is <hi>Good</hi> which brings <hi>benefit</hi> and
<hi>profit</hi> with it. This is the <hi>common</hi> meaſure of Goodneſſe, of which there are few that pronounce any other Verdict. If then (as the Prophet formerly aſſures us) They that <hi>withdraw themſelves,</hi> findes <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Perdition</hi> to be their portion and lot; It muſt follow that they that <hi>draw nigh</hi> to him finde the greateſt <hi>ſecurity;</hi> whilſt the heathen cries
<hi>Procula Jove, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul a fulmine;</hi> Chriſtians experimentally evidence, That the neerer to that <hi>ſhelter,</hi> the further from
<hi>ſtormes,</hi> and that hand which wicked men feel to their
<hi>deſtruction;</hi> underprops theſe from <hi>danger;</hi> and although
<hi>temporall calamities,</hi> overtakes them, yet no more ſhall <hi>burden them</hi> then they <hi>can beare:</hi> Thoſe <hi>waters</hi> ſhall not
<hi>overwhelme them: The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> 2 <hi>Per.</hi> 2.9. and (being that <hi>contrariorum contraria ſunt conſequentia</hi>) That <hi>Poſitive Good,</hi> thoſe full influencies of mercy and favour, which they enjoy, thoſe that are a
<hi>far of,</hi> are <hi>deprived of,</hi> and this the relation of theſe words to the former cleer up: <hi>They that are far of from thee ſhall periſh, But it is good for me to draw neer.</hi> Good by ſuch a
<hi>poſitive goodneſs,</hi> as is contrary to <hi>their evill of miſery.</hi> Thus the very deſcription of wicked mens <hi>calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:170403:173"/> give notice of <hi>Good mens bleſſedneſſe,</hi> and oft times the peculiar contrarieties are expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
65.13, 14. <hi>They ſhall ſing for Joy but ye ſhall houle for vexation of Spirit.</hi> How highly beneficiall this <hi>approach</hi> is, we need not goe farther then this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to finde out. <hi>Good!</hi> for God is
<hi>good to Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>teaches them</hi> out of his
<hi>ſanctuary</hi> to overcome and <hi>triumph over the greateſt temptations. Good</hi> for he is the <hi>ſtrength of their hearts</hi> aand their <hi>Portion for ever. Good for they are preſent with him and he with them. He upholds them by their right hand, and will receive them into Glory.</hi> In confidence of all which, the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.
<hi>We are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them that believe to the ſaving of the ſoul. The bleſſing of ſecurity</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their <hi>Portion,</hi> but they are happy in the addition of the
<hi>poſitive bleſſing</hi> of <hi>ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It doth therfore highly concern us not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooled out of theſe <hi>high benefits:</hi> nor to be inticed from theſe
<hi>mercies;</hi> which are our <hi>own</hi> by eternall <hi>appointment,</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi> Promiſe, <hi>our own by poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intereſt,</hi> and certain <hi>Purchaſe</hi> by Chriſt: <hi>Mercies,</hi> in number
<hi>many, tender</hi> in <hi>exhibition,</hi> and <hi>perfectly,</hi> good, and therefore we may ſafely conclude that <hi>It is good to draw nigh unto God.</hi> And the Apoſtles exhortation <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.21.22. may be very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably entertained here, <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith &amp;c. having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering, for he is faithfull that Promiſed.</hi> That which follows is</p>
                  <p>The Prophets ſecond <hi>Reſolution</hi> which is

It is familiar with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to expreſſe the <hi>Tence, paſt, preſent</hi> and to <hi>come;</hi> under one <hi>notion</hi> and <hi>verbe,</hi> and <hi>good men</hi> oft utter their <hi>Reſolutions</hi> in the <hi>Preter tence:</hi> Thus <hi>Jacob, I have waited,</hi> Gen. 49.18. wherein he reflects not only upon what <hi>He had done,</hi> but reſolves upon the ſame to the end. <hi>Pilat</hi> to ſignifie his unalterable minde, cries <hi>What I have written, I have written.
